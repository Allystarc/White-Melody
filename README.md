White-Melody is a short narrative game that follows the player as they try to escape a mysterious musical dungeon. Players answer questions based on the audio in-game to progress through the dungeon, making decisions along the way that could impact the future of their character. White-Melody sends the message that by believing in yourself you can achieve what you never thought was possible. It also portrays the idea that even in the darkest of times you can make it as long as you give it your best shot.
